When new visitors browse through your website they are confronted with many questions:

* Is this product the right one for me?
* Is it secure to give my payment details to this store?
* Will they ship the product or run with the money?

To answer these questions, potential shoppers are willing to put trust in their peers (social proof). Therefore, when a potential buyer sees how many other people have bought from your store, when was the transaction and which product they bought, they are provided with social proof cues that help them trust your store.

Companies like eBay, Groupon or Agoda know really well the power of social proof to drive sales, that’s why they use it all over their websites.

<strong>Would you like to use social proof to your advantage just like big brands do? WooInfluencer is here to help.</strong>

<h3>Show off social proof like the big brands</h3>
WooInfluencer has been built from scratch to take advantage of consumer psychology proven to increase your conversion rate. It is the only plugin of its kind that offers the flexibility to display the information you want, they way you want it. All of that in just a few minutes.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

The plugin is packaged with the following features:
 
* **Display social proof in your shop pages**.

* **Display social proof in your single product pages**.

= Usage =

Once the plugin is installed and activated, click on the icon “WooInfluencer” that will appear in the left hand side menu.

Here you will find two text editors, one for single product page output and another for shop page output. You may enable either of them (or both) and write inside the editor box your desired message. Inside this box use the shortcode [total_sales] to display sales of a product. You may also specify singular and plural nouns.

For example:

Sales since launch: [total_sales]
This product has been bough [total_sales singular=“time” plural=“times”].
Sold: [total_sales singular=“unit” plural=“units”]. Hurry up, limited stock left!
